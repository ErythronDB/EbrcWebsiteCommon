# EuPathDB Website Privacy Policy

UPDATED: May 23, 2018

## Introduction

EuPathDB (also referred to as 'we' throughout this document) is committed to
protecting its users' data and privacy. The purpose of this page is to provide you
with information about how the data we collect from users of EuPathDB websites is used
or shared. We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time. We encourage you to
visit this page frequently and take note of the date updated field above.

We do not use or share any of your personal information for any purpose unrelated to
the functionality of the websites; however, we do collect some information to help us
understand how our sites are being used in order to improve community support and to
enhance the EuPathDB community's experience when visiting our sites.


## Information Automatically Collected

When you browse EuPathDB sites, certain information about your
visit will be collected. We automatically collect and store
the following type of information about your visit:

- The IP address of the client making the request. Often the IP address
is that of your personal computer or smart phone; however, it might be
that of a firewall or proxy your internet provider manages.

- The operating system and information about the browser used when visiting the site.

- The date and time of each visit.

- Pages visited.

- The address of a referring page. If you click a link on a website that directs you to a EuPathDB page,
 the address of that originating web page will be collected. This
"referer" information is transmitted as part of the browser and server 
communications; it is not based on any marketing or partnering
agreements with the referring site.

This automatically collected information does not identify you
personally unless you include personally identifying information in a
support form request; see the "Contact Us" policy below for details. We
use this information to measure the number of visitors to our site. The
aggregate data  may be included in prospectuses and reports to funding
agencies.

## Information You Directly Provide

The Basket, Favorites, Public Strategies, Gene/Sequence Comment and
GBrowse Track features of the EuPathDB websites require that you
register for an account. A valid email address is required so we can
send you your temporary account password. An anonymous email service can
be used if you do not want to provide personally identifying information.

Your email address will be used to send you infrequent alerts if you
subscribe to receive them. We do not sell or distribute email addresses
to third parties.

We also ask for your name and institution during account registration.
If you add a comment to a Gene or a Sequence, your name and institution
will be displayed with the comment. If you make one of your strategies
public, your name and institution will be displayed with it. We do not
routinely verify the validity of names and institutions associated with
comments or public strategies; however, we will delete accounts or
comments if we believe them to be fraudulent based on inappropriate activity or
posted content. We will not sell or distribute your name or institution
to third parties.

When you log in, the client IP address is recorded. This IP address can
be correlated with the address automatically collected as noted above. If
your user profile personally identifies you, then it may be possible to
associate you with your detailed activity on EuPathDB web sites.

### "Contact Us" Form

The header on each web page includes a "Contact Us" link to a form where
users can submit questions, error reports, feature requests, and dataset
proposals. Submissions through this form are emailed to EuPathDB staff
and recorded in a project management application accessible only by
EuPathDB staff.

The form includes a field for an email address. If the email address
identifies you personally, say if you use your institutional email, then
your correspondence with us will likewise be linked to you. A valid
email is not strictly required, although we can not reply to you without
one.

When you submit the form, your IP address and browser version will be
recorded for internal use. In the case of reported bugs or other site
errors, this information may be used by technical staff to help locate
your session in the server logs to aid in troubleshooting the issue. This
does have the side effect of making it possible to associate an IP address with
an email address which may, in turn, personally identify you. However,
EuPathDB does not publicly release this information.


## How EuPathDB Uses Cookies

EuPathDB uses cookies to associate multiple requests by your web browser
into a stateful session. Cookies are essential to track the state of
query strategies, gene baskets and authentication.

Some cookies persist only for a single session. The information is
recorded temporarily and is erased when the user quits the session or
closes the browser. Others may be persistently stored on the hard drive
of your computer until you manually delete them from a browser folder or
until they expire, which can be months after they were last used.

Cookies can be disabled in your browser (refer to your browser's
documentation for instructions); however, the majority of the website
functionality will be unavailable if cookies are disabled.

### Google Analytics

Google Analytics provides aggregate measurements of website traffic
including counts of page hits and unique users along with statistics on
countries of origin.

The raw measurements and statistics are only available to approved
EuPathDB staff. Aggregated data may be included in prospectuses and
reports to funding agencies.


## Third-Party Websites and Applications

Third-party websites and applications are not exclusively operated or
controlled by EuPathDB. By using these third-party websites, individuals
may be providing nongovernmental third-parties with access to personally
identifying information.

pathogens. Postings may also include information about planned service
maintenance and outages.

Twitter collects profile information such as name and email address

YouTube also requires some information when users create an account,
including an email address, and users may choose to provide a name and
other identifying information in their public profile. Depending on
their individual privacy settings, some personally identifiable
information may be available to other users, including EuPathDB. However
EuPathDB does not collect or use any of that information outside of its
YouTube interactions. You can view videos without signing in to an
account, but you must be a registered user in order to comment.  As

The EuPathDB Galaxy Data Analysis Service is a workspace for large-scale
data analyses. Developed in partnership with [Globus Genomics] (http://globusgenomics.org/genomics/), workspaces
offer a private analysis platform with published workflows and
pre-loaded annotated genomes. The workspace is accessed through the
"Analyze My Experiment" tab on the home page of any EuPathDB resource
and can be used to upload your own data, compose and run custom
workflows, retrieve results and share workflows and data analyses with
colleagues.

The EuPathDB Galaxy Data Analysis Service is hosted by Globus Genomics,
an affiliate of Globus. The first time you visit EuPathDB Galaxy you

Galaxy workspace. Linking your Globus account with your EuPathDB account
is necessary so that input data and analysis results can be transferred
between the two systems.  We encrypt data transfers and storage, but
ultimately we cannot guarantee the security of data transmissions
among EuPathDB, Globus and affiliates, Amazon Cloud Services, and the
